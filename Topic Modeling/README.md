# Topic Modeling (LDA and WordCloud)
Topic Modelling is a technique to extract hidden topics from large volumes of text. The technique I will be introducing is categorized as an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm's name is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and is part of Python's Gensim package.
LDA was first developed by Blei et al. in 2003. LDA is a generative probabilistic model similar to Naive Bayes. It represents topics as word probabilities and allows for uncovering latent or hidden topics as it clusters the words based on their co-occurrence in a respective document.
