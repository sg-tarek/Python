# Simulate tournaments
Assuming we have a CSV file with team names and ratings, the program will simulate a thousand tournaments between the teams and calculates the chance of winning for each team. Each teams and its rating is loaded into a list (list of dictionaries). Afterwards, we simulate a tournament and each time a team wins a count is upated. Based on the overall number of tournaments the probabilities are calculated.
