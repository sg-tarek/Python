# Python

In this repository I will try to group all the different analysis that I have done in different courses at Copenhagen Business School and projects that I worked on in my spare time.

<h3> Data sets </h3>

<h4> style="background-color:powderblue;"> Generate fake trump tweets </h4>

By using the power of transformers, in this case a GPT-2 transformer, I show how to analyze trump tweets and generate [fake] tweets. The power of transformers is astonishing and the boundaries are being pushed every year. Especially now with the lunch of GPT-3 in 2020 which have shown remarkable results.

<h4> Analyzing amazon reviews with neural network </h4>

Amazon product reviews have been used for business analysis in multiple ways already; specifically when applying different machine learning methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP). Some research articles focus on applying supervised machine learning for Sentiment Analysis of the reviews (Haque et al. 2018, Jagdale et al. 2019). Another study built a generative model which created new text based on the existing review text (Dong et al. 2017). Existing studies focus on an amount of reviews ranging between 20.000 to 50.000 reviews in total. With our project, we wanted to focus on a larger data set and examine the most recent data available. During our research, we found out that there existed a large database of Amazon reviews. This database consisted of different versions, depending on the year they were released. For this project, we decided to use the 2018 Amazon review data, which is the newest version of the database that was published in the article of Ni et al. (2020). The amazon review data consists of reviews and metadata about products from multiple categories scraped from the website www.amazon.com. All reviews were created between 1996 and 2018. The total amount of reviews in this data set which could be analyzed (across all product categories) is roughly 233 million. The amount of reviews per category varies enormously, with some categories below 100k reviews (Magazine Subscriptions) and others in the double-digit millions (Sports and Outdoors, Electronics).
