# Analyze DNA sequences
A python script that can identify someone from a database, based on their DNA sequence. The script must be called with two additional command line arguments; a csv database containing the number of times that particular sequences of characters repeat in a list of peopleâ€™s DNA sequences, and a DNA sequence .txt file that we will be analysing and assigning an owner to based on the database in the first argument.
Feel free to propose changes!
